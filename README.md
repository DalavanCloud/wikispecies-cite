Parsing citations on Wikispecies

[Wikispecies](https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) has citations in a range of formats, including templates for individual references, authors, and journals. References may or may not have additional identifiers, such as DOIs, ZooBank UUIDs, links to BHL and Internet Archive, etc.

Authors are often linked to a page in Wikispecies, and this page may in turn be linked to Wikidata, which can have other identifiers (e.g., ORCID, VIAF, ISNI, IPNI, etc.).
